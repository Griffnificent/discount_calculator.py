## **Features**

* **Conditional Discount Application**: Applies a discount only if the percentage is 20% or greater.
* **User Input**: Prompts the user to enter the original price and the discount percentage.
* **Clear Output**: Displays the final price, indicating whether a discount was applied or not.
* **Error Handling**: Includes basic error handling for invalid numerical inputs.
